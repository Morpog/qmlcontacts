Which landing screen of the 3 wireframes should we use? - Tablet stay as is, smaller assets not till 1.4
When do we show the landing screen vs the MCard default? - always show mecard shift graphics down
Why do wireframes only show one possible vCard on an SD Card? - new wireframes coming show dialog to select vcf files from sdcard. If there are multiple vCards on the SDCard need to show all .vcf files and let the user select which to import from or import all. - new wf coming
